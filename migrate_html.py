<h2>Purposes of the web site</h2>
<p>This web site is intended for people who have been on CCIW camps, those interested in doing so,

<ol>
  <li>To provide information about CCIW and the camps it runs to all those interested in attending</li>
  <li>To provide a friendly, fun, safe, healthy environment in which those who have attended camps
      can continue their friendships and encourage each other to love the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>

<h2>Principles</h2>
<p>When using the message boards and private messages, the following principles
 must be remembered:</p>

  <li>Colossians 4:6 <i>"Let your conversation be always full of grace,
    seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone".</i></li>
  <li>Romans 12:17,18 <i>"Do not repay evil for evil.  Be careful to do what is right
   in the eyes of everybody. <b>If it is possible, as far as it depends on you,
    live at peace with everyone</b>."</i></li>
  <li>Hebrews 13:17 <i>"Obey your leaders and submit to their authority. They keep
    watch over you as men who must give an account. Obey them so that their
    work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no advantage to
    you."</i>

    to this situation, where those in authority are the moderators and
    web site administrators.</p></li>

<p>Below is the doctrinal basis of CCIW, to which all the directors subscribe and which forms the basis of what we seek to do
 and teach.</p>

<p>We accept the Holy Scriptures, as originally given, as the infallible Word of God, of divine inspiration. Recognising them as our sole authority in all matters of faith and practice, we believe the doctrines taught therein. In particular we believe:</p>
<ol style='list-style-type: lower-roman'>
<li>in the only true and living God, the Holy Trinity of divine Persons in  perfect unity, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, each of whom is co-equal and co-eternal, and sovereign in creation, providence and redemption.</li>
    <li>in the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is holy, righteous, full of grace, mercy, compassion and love. In His infinite love He sent forth the Son, that the world through Him might be saved. </li>
    <li>in the Lord Jesus Christ, the incarnate Son of God, whose true humanity and full deity were mysteriously and really joined in the unity of His divine Person. We believe in His virgin birth, in His perfect life and teaching, in His substitutionary, atoning death on the cross, where He triumphed over Satan, sin and death in His bodily resurrection and ascension into heaven, where he now sits in glory at the right hand of God.</li>
    <li>in the Holy Spirit, the third Person of the Godhead, whose work is indispensable to regenerate the sinner, to lead him to repentance, to give him faith in Christ, to sanctify the believer in this present life and fit him to enjoy fellowship with God. For spiritual power and effectiveness His ministry is essential to the individual Christian and to the Church. </li>
    <li>that as the result of the Fall all men are sinful by nature. Sin pollutes and controls them, infects every part of their being, renders them guilty in the sight of a holy God and subject to the penalty, which in His wrath and condemnation, He has decreed against it.</li>
    <li>that through faith (and only faith) in the Lord Jesus Christ, whose death was a perfect oblation and satisfaction for our sins, the sinner is freely justified by God who, instead of reckoning to us our sins, reckons Christs righteousness to our account. Salvation is therefore by grace and not by human merit. </li>
    <li>that the Lord Jesus Christ will return personally, visibly, and gloriously to this earth, to receive His saints to Himself and to be seen of all men. As the righteous Judge, He will divide all men into two, and only two, categories - the saved and the lost. Those whose faith is in Christ will be saved eternally, and will enter into the joy of their Lord, sharing with Him His inheritance in heaven. The unbelieving will be condemned by Him to hell where, eternally they will be punished for their sins under the righteous judgement of God. </li>

<h2>Insurance</h2>
<p>Many people ask about insurance on camp. </p>
<p>Insurance for camps like this falls into 2 basic
categories:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Public Liability </li>
    <li>Personal Accident cover </li>
</ol>

<p>Public Liability is a cover which provides protection for
campers should they have an accident which was due
to the <strong>negligence</strong> of CCIW or any of the camp leaders or
officers.  This sort of insurance also provides 3rd party cover for the camp for
situations where we may be liable for damage incurred by people not
connected with the camp. Standard cover up to &pound;1,000,000 is provided.</p>

<p>If anyone should want to see this policy
it will be available on camp.</p>

<p>Personal Accident cover is a
"no-blame" type of insurance which will pay out
in the case of injury even if it is a simple accident.
i.e. no blame attached. </p>

<p>CCIW does not provide this type of insurance cover but if you wish to have it
tick the relevant question on the Booking Form and we will send you information
for you to obtain your own cover.</p>

<p>Also, note that insurance for adventure activities is provided by the Licensed Activity Provider.</p>

<p>Our insurance company is Ansvar Ltd.</p>

html.append(('about_camp_general', '/info/about-camp/', 'About camp', """

<div style='text-align: center'><strong>Camp is really great fun, but so much more</strong></div>

<h2>What is camp really about?</h2>
<p>Well, there are lots of different answers.</p>

<p>Some will say <strong>friendship</strong>, and certainly we know of some 
wonderful friendships formed on camps which have lasted and blossomed over 
the years, benefitting not only the campers but also the churches to which they belong.</p>

<p>Some will say <strong>fun</strong>.  Well, we certainly do have fun, with something to 
suit all who have a sense of adventure.  Whether it is canoeing, gorge walking, raft building, 
wide games, bivouacking, table tennis, football, volleyball, camp concerts, tent life, 
tent inspection, washing up, trips to the coast or even shopping, there is something for 
everyone.  There are optional extras including rock climbing, pony trekking etc.  
Please bring extra pocket money for these.</p>

<p>Whilst friendship and fun are really important, at the heart of camp is a person, <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>.  
He makes camp special in so many ways but especially as His gospel is taught and 
explained in the morning services and tent Bible studies.</p>

<h2>The Aim</h2>
<p>The aim of the camps is the presentation of the Christian faith to young people in 
the context of a safe &amp; healthy outdoor camp environment.</p>

<p>Safety and a wholesome environment for campers is paramount.  For this reason the 
teams will be led by experienced leaders and where possible a husband and wife team.
  Quite often this means that camp life will be enhanced by the presence of young children on site.</p>

<p>The programme will include a morning service and evening tent Bible study every day except 
Sunday, which is kept special with two services and a quiet programme in between.</p>

<p>Transport will also be provided from the station/bus stops in Tywyn/Barmouth to 
the camp sites if you let us know when you require it.</p>

<h2>Insurance <a href="/info/legal/" title="Legal information">(more info...)</a></h2>
<p>CCIW is insured for public liability.  Public liability is a cover which provides protection 
for campers should they have an accident which was due to the negligence of the 
leaders or organisers of Christian Camps in Wales.</p>

<p>The camp fee does not include personal accident cover for campers, i.e. if a camper recieves 
an injury on camp for which CCIW is not liable, there will be no entitlement to 
any payment from CCIW's insurers.</p>

<p>Adventure activities are provided by Licensed Activity Providers who have their 
own public liability insurance cover.</p>


<h2>Booking</h2>
<p><b>The cost for a single camper 
is &pound;87. 2nd camper from the same family &pound;63. 
Subsequent campers from the same family &pound;30.</b></p>

<p>Please book early to avoid disappointment and to aid planning.  We will try to 
be flexible with regard to bookings in order to accomodate campers from the 
same youth group, family, church etc.  If you don't have a booking form, 
you can <a href="/thisyear/booking/">get one here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Please send with the form a deposit of &pound;20</b>.  In the event of your 
first choice being full we will offer you an alternative camp, your deposit back 
or the option to go on a waiting list.  But if you accept an alternative camp you 
cannot remain on the waiting list of your first choice as well.</p>
