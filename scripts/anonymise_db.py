"""Functions to remove sensitive user information

This script is used as a one-off to produce a DB that had realistic
amounts/structure of data but can be shared without problems.

The following rules are to be applied:

- For models with no personally identifying information, the entire model should be kept
  fully intact (ignored). This includes many internal Django models, and many models
  from third party apps.

- For models with personal information:
  - person names are replaced with realistic looking random names.
  - address are replaced with randomised addresses.
  - dates relating to personal information such as date of birth
    are replaced with a date in the same year..
  - other dates are left as they are.
  - sensitive longer text fields are replaced with text of similar size.
  - any potentially sensitive booleans are set to a sensible default.
  - fields that represent internal state or tracking are left as they are.

- For temporary tables that may have sensitive data, such as outgoing email or
  mailer logs, we truncate the table.

In some cases when randomising we put extra effort in to maintain the structure
of existing data, in order to keep realistic data. For example, if the same name
(or other value) is used in a group of related records, we try to replace it
with the same name each time e.g. Bookings from the same BookingAccount over
several years will be given the same 'first_name' and 'last_name'

"""
# Usage normally looks like this:


# fab get-and-load-production-db
# ./scripts/anonymise_db.py

# Copy the notes at the end into a text file

# fab local-db-dump ../db_backups/anonymized.$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H.%M.%S).pgdump

# Finally delete the downloaded production databases, keeping only the anonymized copies

# Anonymising Application and other models:
#
# - We try to keep non-sensitive data for realistic values
#
# - We preserve structure (FKs)
#
# - We have a lot of repeated data in Application and other models (the users
#   fill in the same data year after year). In some cases this makes a
#   difference to functionality (e.g. matching referees to previously defined
#   referees, where we don't have proper FKs to do matching, and functionality
#   that displays differences from one year to the next). So, we have some
#   mapping functionality defined below to keep the same random value that
#   was used the first time for the input value.
#
# - Since we are keeping FKs/PKs, and we assume our application might leak PKs
#   (via URLs etc), we have to be paranoid about removing/randomising
#   potentially sensitive information e.g. even the existence of text in
#   `youth_work_declined' is something we should hide.
