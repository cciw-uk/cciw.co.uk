{% autoescape off %}Dear camp leaders,

On their application form, {{ officer.first_name }} {{ officer.last_name }} indicated that they do NOT consent to having a DBS check done. It is possible that this was simply a mistake. In this case, after contacting them you can edit and correct their application form:

Contact details:

E-mail: {{ application.address_email }}
Tel:    {{ application.address_tel }}
Mobile: {{ application.address_mobile }}

Edit application form:

https://www.cciw.co.uk{% url 'admin:officers_application_change' application.id %}

If it is correct that they do not consent to having a DBS check done, they cannot come on camp, and need to be removed from the camp officer list:

{% for camp in camps %}https://www.cciw.co.uk{% url 'cciw-officers-officer_list' year=camp.year slug=camp.slug_name %}
{% endfor %}

Thanks!

{{ sender.first_name }} {{ sender.last_name }}

Sent via the CCIW website.
