      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>
        This page shows places in the "queue" that are ready to be allocated. Some manual inputs are required, and
        you must then use the buttons at the end to confirm the places.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“Officer child” - use this to mark campers who are the children of
          officers serving on the same camp.</li>
        <li>“Chosen first timer” - for campers coming for the first time, and are associated with serving officers,
          this option can used to increase priority for the selected campers.

          It can applied a limited number of times - up to {{ FIRST_TIMER_PERCENTAGE }}%
          of the total places for a camp.</li>
      </ul>
