{% autoescape off %}Hi {{ first_name }},

This is a repeat email.

An account has been set up for you on the CCiW website, which allows
you to fill in application form for coming on a CCiW camp.

Below are the instructions for filling in the application form online.
When you have finished filling the form in, it will be emailed to the
leader of the camp, who will need to send reference forms to the
referees you have specified.

To fill in the application form:

1) If you haven't already set a password, or you have forgotten it,
   please set your password here:

     https://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

   You must do this within **{{ PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT_DAYS }} days**
   of receiving this email.

   Otherwise please do the password reset procedure here:

     https://{{ domain }}{% url 'admin_password_reset' %}

2) Then log in here:

     https://{{ domain }}{% url 'cciw-officers-index' %}

     Your username is: {{ username }}

3) Choose from the options. If you have already completed an
   application form online, your new one will start with the answers
   from your previous one. Some tickboxes will be blanked out and you
   will have to fill them in again, but it should only take a few
   minutes.

   If you have not already completed an application form, you will
   have to start by creating a new one.

4) Fill in the form.

   You can save your work at any time (using the 'Save' button at the
   bottom) and come back to it later if you want. When you have
   finished and want to submit the application form to the leaders, you
   need to check the 'Completed' checkbox at the bottom and press
   'Save'.

   Please note that if you have any validation errors (marked in red
   when you try to save), your data won't have been saved. You'll need
   to correct the data before it is actually saved.


If you have any problems, please email me at {{ webmasteremail }}

The CCiW webmaster.
