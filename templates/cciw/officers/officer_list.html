<h2>Camp list</h2>

<h3>Add officer</h3>

<p>If you need to add a new officer to the website system, currently this
  should be done by the webmaster.  <br /> For adding existing users to your
  camp list, use the following link:</p>

<ul><li><a rel="external" href="{% url django.contrib.admin.views.main.add_stage "officers","invitation" %}">Add invitation</a></li></ul>


<h3>Current list</h3>

<p>Officers can be removed from your camp list by clicking the
  'Remove' links (this will open a new window, and you will have to
  confirm the removal).  Details of officers (e.g. email address) can
  be changed by clicking 'Edit'.</p>
