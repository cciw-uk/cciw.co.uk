Dear {{ account.name }},
{% if expired %}
The following place(s) on CCIW camps have expired because no payment was
received within 24 hours of booking online.
{% else %}
You have booked the following place(s) on CCIW camps, but have not yet
paid:
{% endif %}
----------------------------------------
{% for b in bookings %}
Name: {{ b.name }}
Camp: {{ b.camp }}
Dates: {{ b.camp.start_date|date:"d F" }} to {{ b.camp.end_date|date:"d F Y" }}
{% endfor %}
----------------------------------------
{% if expired %}
The places have been moved back to your 'basket'. If you still want them,
you can book and pay here:

{{ url_start }}{% url 'cciw.bookings.views.list_bookings' %}

{% else %}
If you do not pay within 12 hours, the bookings will expire so that
other people will be able to take the places.

Please go to the following URL to pay online:

{{ url_start }}{% url 'cciw.bookings.views.pay' %}
{% endif %}
If you think you have in fact paid, or have had some other problem
with the web site that is preventing you from paying, please reply to
this email and let us know, so that we can look into it.

Thanks,

The cciw.co.uk team.
