  <h2>Payment methods</h2>

  <p>Payment is done via Paypal. You do not need to have a Paypal account – any
    credit card or debit card can be used.</p>

  <p> Please note that if you have recently paid, it can take a few minutes for
    our records to be updated - please do not pay twice!</p>


  <h2>Balance</h2>

  <p>Your total amount outstanding is:</p>

  <p><b>Balance: £{{ balance_full }}</b></p>

  {% if balance_full == 0 %}
    <p>You have nothing to pay.</p>
  {% endif %}

  {% if balance_full < 0 %}
    <b>We owe you this money!</b> Our team will ensure that you are
    refunded this amount.</p>
  {% endif %}

  {% if balance_full > 0 %}

    {% include "cciw/bookings/pending_payment_notice.html" %}

    {% if balance_due_now > 0 %}

      <p>This amount is now due.
        {% if installment %}
          If it is a difficult to pay the full amount, and you have an agreement
          with the booking secretary, please enter the amount that you are able
          to pay at the moment.
