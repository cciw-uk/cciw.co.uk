  <p>This is the starting point for <b>booking</b> camper places online, and <b>paying</b>
    online. If you are wanting to come on camp as a leader/officer, this booking
    system is not for you â€“ please see the <a href="/helpers/officers/">leaders and officers</a> section.</p>


  {% if not booking_open %}
    <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: Booking is not yet open for this year - you will not be
      able to complete the booking process at this stage.</strong></p>
  {% endif %}

  {% if booking_open and not any_bookings_possible %}
    <p><strong>No places are available on any camps! You may continue, but you
      will only be able to complete the booking process for a new place on a
      camp if you can arrange an exception with the camp leaders.</strong></p>
  {% endif %}

  <p>To book online, you must have a <b>credit card, debit card, or Paypal account</b>,
    and must not be a minor.</p>

  <p>To get started, we first need your <b>email address</b>. Note - this is the
    email address of the person booking and paying, not of the camper. We will
    send an email to this address to confirm it is correct and log you in.</p>

    <p><input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit" /></p>
