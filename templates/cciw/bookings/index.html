      Transport to and from camp is not included. On some camps there may be the
      option to do an additional activity from an external provider (e.g.
      paintballing, rock-climbing), and these cost extra. Campers should bring
      money to cover these if they want to do them, along with any pocket money
      for spending in the camp tuck shop, book shop or in local towns or shops
      they might visit.

  <p>You can <a href="{% url 'cciw-bookings-start' %}">book and pay online</a>,

    <p>Due to very high demand, we cannot guarantee a place to everyone. Our
      system is as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Bookings will be open from <b>{{ booking_open_data.opens_for_booking_on|date:"j F" }}</b>.</li>
      <li>The initial booking period will finish on <b>{{ booking_open_data.closes_for_initial_period|date:"j F" }}</b>.</li>
      <li>All bookings made during this period will then be considered <b>together</b>.</li>
      <li>A priority system will be applied for some places, based on previous
        attendance and some other factors.</li>
      <li>Any remaining places will be decided by a lottery system.</li>
      <li>At this point we will notify you of the outcome.</li>
      <li>Those who have not been given places will automatically be placed on a
        waiting list, in which case you may be offered a place if other bookings are cancelled.</li>
      <li>Bookings after the initial period will still be accepted and added to the
        waiting list, but due to high demand they are unlikely to be offered
        places.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We're sorry that some people will inevitably be disappointed!
    </p>

  {% endif %}

  </p>

  <p>When you book online, {{ full_payment_due_time }} before camp starts you
    will be asked to pay the full amount.</p>

  <h3>Officers and leaders</h3>

  <p>If you are wanting to come on camp as a leader/officer, you cannot book a
    place using this system – please instead see the information about applying
    to be a <a href="/helpers/officers/">leader or officer</a>.</p>
