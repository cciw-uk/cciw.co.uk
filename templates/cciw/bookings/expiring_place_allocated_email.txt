Dear {{ account.name }},

Having been on the waiting list for a place on a CCiW camp,
you have now been allocated the following place:

Name: {{ booking.name }}
Camp: {{ booking.camp }}
Dates: {{ booking.camp.start_date|date:"d F" }} to {{ booking.camp.end_date|date:"d F Y" }}

If you want to keep this place you MUST accept the place by clicking on the link
below, within {{ booking_expires_after_display }}, or the place will expire.

ACCEPT PLACE:

{{ accept_place_url }}

If you no longer want the place, you may cancel it by using the link below:

CANCEL PLACE:

{{ reject_place_url }}

If you do nothing, the place will expire after {{ booking_expires_after_display }}.

The camp leaders will be in contact with more details in due time.

Many thanks!

The cciw.co.uk team.
