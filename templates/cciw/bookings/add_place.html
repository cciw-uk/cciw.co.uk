        <p>The 2nd child from the same family is eligible for '2nd child discount'.
          Subsequent children from the same family are eligible for '3rd child
          discount'.</p>

        <p>A camper booking to go on a second camp in the same year must pay the
          full price amount.</p>

        <p>If you will struggle to pay the full fee, you can also apply for a
          custom discount. The exact price will have to be arranged by the booking
          secretary: you will need to fill in this page, then contact the booking
          secretary, and later complete the online booking process if you choose
          this option.</p>

          We collect medical and health details to ensure we can provide a safe

        <p>This includes, for example, significant deafness or blindness, unstabilised
          diabetes or epilepsy, life-threatening allergies, or other conditions which
          would normally require supervision in school life, such as autism. You do not
          need to tick this box for conditions that are easily managed by medication,
          where the camper can administer the medication themselves.</p>

        <p>If the box is ticked, a camp leader will then have to manually approve this
          place before booking and payment can proceed. This system is needed to avoid
          disappointment in the case where we will not be able to cater for the camper's
          condition on camp.</p>

        <h3>Camper agreement</h3>

        <p>The camper must agree to observe the camp's <a href="/booking/code-of-conduct/" target="_blank">code of conduct</a>. Failure to obey
          camp rules can result in the camper being sent home, with no refund.</p>

        <h3>Parent/guardian agreement</h3>

        <p>In the event of any medical treatment becoming necessary during the camp,
          every effort will be made to contact the parent/guardian. However, parents are
          required to authorise the leadership team to act in their absence where urgent
          treatment becomes necessary.</p>

        <p>If both camper and parent/guardian agree to the above, tick the box to continue:</p>

        <h3>Photographs</h3>

        <p>We sometimes take photos during camp for use in camp publicity purposes. If you

          tick the box below. This is optional.</p>
