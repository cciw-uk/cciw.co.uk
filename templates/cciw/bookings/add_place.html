        We collect medical and health details to ensure we can provide a safe

        medical details to medical professionals as necessary.

        after the camper, please indicate below.</p>

      <p>This includes, for example, significant deafness or blindness, unstabilised
        diabetes or epilepsy, life-threatening allergies, or other conditions which
        would normally require supervision in school life, such as autism. You do not
        need to tick this box for conditions that are easily managed by medication,
        where the camper can administer the medication themselves.</p>

      <p>If the box is ticked, a camp leader will then have to manually approve this
        place before booking and payment can proceed. This system is needed to avoid
        disappointment in the case where we will not be able to cater for the camper's
        condition on camp.</p>

      <h2>Agreements</h2>

      <h3>Camper agreement</h3>

      <p>The camper must agree to observe the camp's <a href="/booking/code-of-conduct/" target="_new">code of conduct</a>. Failure to obey
        camp rules can result in the camper being sent home, with no refund.</p>

      <h3>Parent/guardian agreement</h3>

      <p>In the event of any medical treatment becoming necessary during the camp,
        every effort will be made to contact the parent/guardian. However, parents are
        required to authorise the leadership team to act in their absence where urgent
        treatment becomes necessary.</p>

      <p>If both camper and parent/guardian agree to the above, tick the box to continue:</p>

      {% cciw_form_field form 'agreement' 'Agree to above conditions' %}

      <h3>Photographs</h3>

      <p>We sometimes take photos during camp for use in camp publicity purposes. If you
        give permission for photos taken of the camper to be used in this way, please
        tick the box below. This is optional.</p>
