include conditions that would affect the safety of camp or our ability to look
after the camper, please indicate below.</p>

<p>This includes, for example, significant deafness or blindness, unstabilised
diabetes or epilepsy, life-threatening allergies, or other conditions which
would normally require supervision in school life, such as autism. You do not
need to tick this box for conditions that are easily managed by medication,
where the camper can administer the medication themselves.</p>

<p>If the box is ticked, a camp leader will then have to manually approve this
place before booking and payment can proceed. This system is needed to avoid
disappointment in the case where we will not be able to cater for the camper's
condition on camp.</p>

<h2>Agreements</h2>

<h3>Camper agreement</h3>

<p>The camper must agree to observe the camp's code of conduct. Failure to obey
camp rules can result in the camper being sent home, with no refund.</p>

<h3>Parent/guardian agreement</h3>

<p>In the event of any medical treatment becoming necessary during the camp
every effort will be made to contact the parent/guardian. However, parents are
required to authorise the leadership team to act in their absence where urgent
treatment becomes necessary.</p>

<p>If both camper and parent/guardian agree, tick the box to continue:</p>
