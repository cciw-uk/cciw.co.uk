        <p>If you will struggle to pay the full fee, you can also apply for a
          custom discount. The exact price will have to be arranged by the booking
          secretary: you will need to fill in this page, then contact the booking
          secretary, and later complete the online booking process if you choose
          this option.</p>

          We collect medical and health details to ensure we can provide a safe

          medical details to medical professionals as necessary.

        <p>If the illnesses, allergies or learning/behavioural difficulties above
          include conditions that would affect the safety of camp or our ability to look
          after the camper, please indicate below.</p>

        <p>This includes, for example, significant deafness or blindness, unstabilised
          diabetes or epilepsy, life-threatening allergies, or other conditions which
          would normally require supervision in school life, such as autism. You do not
          need to tick this box for conditions that are easily managed by medication,
          where the camper can administer the medication themselves.</p>

        <p>If the box is ticked, a camp leader will then have to manually approve this
          place before booking and payment can proceed. This system is needed to avoid
          disappointment in the case where we will not be able to cater for the camper's
          condition on camp.</p>

        <p><b>Tent sharing:</b>
          While we cannot promise that all campers will be sleeping in the same
          tent as their friends, we try to have at least one friend with each
          camper where possible. You may name one or more friends below.</p>

        <p>Please note that tents are normally organised by age order, and are
          strictly sex segregated.
        </p>

        {% cciw_form_field form 'friends_for_tent_sharing' %}


        <h2>Agreements</h2>

        <h3>Camper agreement</h3>

        <p>The camper must agree to observe the camp's <a href="/booking/code-of-conduct/" target="_blank">code of conduct</a>. Failure to obey
          camp rules can result in the camper being sent home, with no refund.</p>

        <h3>Parent/guardian agreement</h3>

        <p>In the event of any medical treatment becoming necessary during the camp,
          every effort will be made to contact the parent/guardian. However, parents are
          required to authorise the leadership team to act in their absence where urgent
          treatment becomes necessary.</p>

        <p>If both camper and parent/guardian agree to the above, tick the box to continue:</p>

        {% cciw_form_field form 'agreement' %}

        <h3>Photographs</h3>

        <p>We sometimes take photos during camp for use in camp publicity purposes. If you
          give permission for photos taken of the camper to be used in this way, please
          tick the box below. This is optional.</p>
