<h2>Booking process information</h2>

{% if booking_open_data.opens_for_booking_on %}

  <p>To ensure a fair and reliable booking process, CCiW has updated how
    campers are booked due to high demand in previous years.</p>

  <h3>Booking Period: {{ booking_open_data.opens_for_booking_on|date:"jS F" }} to {{ booking_open_data.closes_for_initial_period_on|date:"jS F" }}</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>During this period, bookings are not "first come, first served"</li>
    <li>Places may be booked at any point during the period</li>
    <li>All information entered at the time of booking must be accurate</li>
    <li>No deposit is required during the booking phase</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Oversubscribed Camps</h3>

  <p>If a camp is oversubscribed after the booking period closes, places will be allocated automatically using the
    following priority order:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Children of CCiW leaders or officers currently serving</li>
    <li>Returning campers (prioritised by number of years previously attended)</li>
    <li>Campers who were on the waiting list last year and not offered a place</li>
    <li>Campers with a sibling attending the same camp</li>
    <li>Remaining places allocated by lottery, subject to availability</li>

  </ol>

  <h3>Multiple Camp Applications</h3>

  <p>If a camper is offered a place on one camp, any other applications will be
    treated as the lowest of the above priorities. Camps are confirmed
    sequentially, so CCiW cannot guarantee which camp will be confirmed first.</p>

  {% if booking_open_data.initial_notifications_on %}
    <h3>Notifications</h3>

    <p>Families will be informed by {{ booking_open_data.initial_notifications_on|date:"jS F" }} whether:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>their child has been offered a place, or:</li>
      <li>their child has been placed on the waiting list.</li>
    </ul>
  {% endif %}

  {% if booking_open_data.payments_due_on %}
    <h3>Payment Information</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Full payment is due by {{ booking_open_data.payments_due_on|date:"jS F" }}.</li>
      <li>If payment is not received, or a payment plan has not been agreed by this date, the
        place will be offered to the next camper on the waiting list.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Payment Plans</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Families requiring a payment plan must <a href="{% url 'cciw-contact_us-send' %}?bookings">contact the Bookings
        Secretary</a> by {{ booking_open_data.payments_due_on|date:"jS F" }}.</li>
      <li>Failure to do so will result in the place being offered to the next camper. </li>

    </ul>

  {% endif %}
  <h3>Waiting List</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>All bookings made during the initial booking period that are not given
      places remain on the waiting list in their ranked order.</li>
    <li>Any bookings made after this point will be added below the original
      group, in date order.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Questions</h3>

  <p>If you have any questions, please <a href="{% url 'cciw-contact_us-send' %}?bookings">contact the Bookings
    Secretary</a>.</p>
