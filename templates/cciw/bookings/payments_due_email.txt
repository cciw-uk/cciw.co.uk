{% autoescape off %}Hello {{ account.name }},

You have payments due for CCIW.

This usually happens when you have only paid the deposit for a place
on camp, and the full amount is now due. Alternatively, you may have
failed to pay a deposit, or might have payments from last year that
are still due.

The amount you need to pay is: Â£{{ account.balance_due }}

If you have a credit/debit card, or a PayPal account, you can pay this
money online:

You can also pay by cheque, and post to the address given here:

https://www.cciw.co.uk{% url 'cciw-bookings-index' %}


If you think there has been some mistake, please contact the booking
secretary by replying to this email.

Thanks!
