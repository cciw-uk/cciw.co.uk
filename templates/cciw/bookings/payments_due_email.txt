{% autoescape off %}Hello {{ account.name }},

You have payments due for CCIW.

This usually happens when you have only paid the deposit for a place
on camp, and the full amount is now due. Alternatively, you may have
failed to pay a deposit, or might have payments from last year that
are still due.

The amount you need to pay is: Â£{{ account.balance_due }}

Please click on the link below, or copy and paste it into a web browser,
to pay online:

https://{{ domain }}{% url 'cciw-bookings-pay' %}?bt={{ token }}

Please do this within a few days or the link above will expire.

If you think there has been some mistake, please contact the booking
secretary by replying to this email.

Thanks!
