This code is not intended to be an out of the box solution for anyone
-- it is a snapshot of the source code of the CCIW website made
available simply for those who wish to browse the source (or copy it
-- it is available under a BSD license).  I don't have the time to
support anything here (apart from the 'validator' app which happens to
be included but is distributed separately), so you are completely on
your own in terms of working things out!

Nor is it meant to be 'best practice' Django -- Django has changed
since the project has started, and I don't claim to be the world's
greatest Python/Django programmer anyway.

It also doesn't include various bit and pieces that would not have
been useful to other people e.g. my database migration scripts and
various media files.
