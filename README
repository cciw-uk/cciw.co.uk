CCIW source code
================

This code is not intended to be an out of the box solution for anyone -- it
is a snapshot of the source code of the CCIW website made available simply
for those who wish to browse the source (or copy it under a BSD license).  I
don't have the time to support anything here (apart from the 'validator' app
which happens to be included but is distributed separately), so you are
completely on your own in terms of working things out!

Nor is it meant to be 'best practice' Django -- Django has changed
since the project has started, and I don't claim to be the world's
greatest Python/Django programmer anyway.

It also doesn't include various bit and pieces that would not have
been useful to other people e.g. my database migration scripts and
various media files.

URLS
----

You should be using the {{ url }} tag instead of hard coding URLs as I have
done -- Adrian wrote RegexURLResolver after I wrote this.

Views
-----

These are done using a mixture of classic functions and Class Based Views,
depending on whether the move to CBVs was worth the effort. This means that
there is sometimes some duplication between the function based way of doing
something and the equivalent CBV way, and you need to be comfortable with both
styles.


INSTALLATION HINTS
==================
- The fabfile contains info about how to develop and deploy
- You need to create a settings_priv.py withthe various settings that I cannot
  release publically (database, passwords, secret key)
