CCIW source code
================

This code is not intended to be an out of the box solution for anyone -- it
is a snapshot of the source code of the CCIW website made available simply
for those who wish to browse the source (or copy it under a BSD license).  I
don't have the time to support anything here (apart from the 'validator' app
which happens to be included but is distributed separately), so you are
completely on your own in terms of working things out!

Nor is it meant to be 'best practice' Django -- Django has changed
since the project has started, and I don't claim to be the world's
greatest Python/Django programmer anyway.

It also doesn't include various bit and pieces that would not have
been useful to other people e.g. my database migration scripts and
various media files.

URLS
----
You should be using the {{ url }} tag instead of hard coding URLs as I have
done -- Adrian wrote RegexURLResolver after I wrote this.

INSTALLATION HINTS
==================
- You need to have the unpacked directory in your Python path somewhere
- You need to create a settings_pri.py file (should be obvious if you
  try to run it).  This file needs the various settings that I cannot
  release publically (database, passwords, secret key)
