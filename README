CCIW source code
================

A lot of this code is quite old. It has been updated to work with latest
Django, but might be quite different if written from scratch.

URLS
----

A lot of code needs to be updated to use the {{ url }} tag which was added
after I wrote the bulk of the code.

Views
-----

These are done using a mixture of classic functions and Class Based Views,
depending on whether the move to CBVs was worth the effort. This means that
there is sometimes some duplication between the function based way of doing
something and the equivalent CBV way, and you need to be comfortable with both
styles.


INSTALLATION HINTS
==================
- The fabfile contains info about how to develop and deploy
- You need to create a settings_priv.py with the various settings that I cannot
  release publically (database, passwords, secret key)
