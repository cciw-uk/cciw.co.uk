# To enable Applications to be shared between camps, and in some cases to belong
# to no camps, there is no direct connection between a Camp and an Application.
# This means we need another way to associate them. We also need to have a
# concept of 'this year', so that an officer submits once application form 'per
# year'. To manage this logic we're using dates of camps (which are clustered in
# the summer) and the invitations to camp that am officer has.

# Logic for dates:
# - an application is considered valid for a camp/year if the date_saved
#   - is within 12 months of the start date of the camp/first camp that year
#   - is after the previous year's camps' end dates.
#
# i.e. we assume all camps happen in a cluster, and application forms are
# submitted in the period leading up to that cluster.
