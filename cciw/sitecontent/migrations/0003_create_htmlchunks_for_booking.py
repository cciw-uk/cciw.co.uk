<h2>Booking</h2>

<p>There are two ways to book for camp:</p>

<h3>Paper booking</h3>

<p>You will need the booking form which comes with our camp brochure, which we can post to you, or you can download below. You will need to include a cheque to pay a deposit of Â£20 with your booking</p>

<h3>Online booking</h3>

<p>You can <a href="/booking/start/">book and pay online</a>, providing you have a debit card, credit card, or PayPal account.</p>

<p>If you book online, you can see how many places there are left in real time, and your place will be confirmed immediately. However, you will have to pay the full amount when booking, not just the deposit. For refunds, the same rules apply to both paper bookings and online bookings.<p>
