      \ than Tywyn, but still has plenty of room for the 50 campers it can accomodate.\
      \ It has a main marquee for services and campsite activities, and a good sized\
      \ playing space including a volleyball area. There is also a picturesque river\
      \ just on the edge of the campsite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a multi-purpose building\
      \ which houses a kitchen and eating/games areas. The site also has a toilet\
      \ and wash-block, (including showers) for both males and females.</p>\r\n\r\n\
      <p>Llys Andreas is very accessible, just two minutes off the main road between\
      \ Barmouth & Harlech and just 10 mins from Tal-y-bont railway station. Barmouth\
      \ also has a leisure centre, which has a five-a-side football pitch, as well\
      \ a beach, a fair and plenty of shops. There is also a very pleasant beach much\
      \ closer to Llys Andreas, which is a great spot for barbeques, bathing or bivouacking!\r\
